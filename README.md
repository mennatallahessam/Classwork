About me
May your life be filled with everlasting peace! (this is how we say hi in Egypt)
I’m Mennatallah Essam (but you can just call me Menna :)). This picture is of me in the snow of the storm here in America. I chose it mainly because I felt that it represents how much I enjoy stepping outside of my comfort zone. I have always been keen on experiencing new things. I’m always pushing myself to grow by meeting new people, dealing with diversity as well as being aware of all different cultures and habits. I’m excited to be in this course. I am very curious to see how much this practical-learning course will teach me and work on enhancing my skills. A fun fact about me is that I studied at a boarding school in Egypt because I wanted to actually experience complete independence from such a young age.

My Coding experience
I am currently a junior studying computer engineering at the American university in Cairo. I first entered the major having no background about what coding even is. I was just filled with curiosity to discover it. I took CS1, CS2, applied data structures along with analysis and design of algorithms which gave me a solid foundation in coding, and they were all taught using C++ programming language. I worked on many projects where I used different compilers like VS code, Clion and MSVC  and tools like git bash and github desktop. I have also taken online courses away from university in HTML5, CSS and javascript which helped me so much in getting familiar with the frontend part of web development. In my sophomore year, I have worked on creating a website for dyslexic individuals which helps them in learning; I along with my teammates used HTML, CSS and Javascript to create the front end of a website provided with many features like changing text size, highlighting important words, shadowing words and so on. This is one of my favourite projects in university so far. 


Using this course
I personally plan to use what I learn in this course to strengthen my web development skills since I only have a background in the frontend part. I want to be capable of creating well-structured and more effective projects that would help me land internships during the summer break. The main reason I chose this course and tried to enroll in it even though it was already full is that it is project-based. I believe that working hands-on helps me improve my practical skills much more. I see this knowledge being useful in future classes, projects, and real-world applications.
